# 章節標題
為什麼優秀的人都有科學腦（書）- 「在中國市占率百分之一」有那麼容易嗎？（章節）

## 具體實例
- 投擲冷凍馬鈴薯在牆上，其碎塊依大小分排列是鐘形曲線。但若增加冷凍馬鈴薯重量後，排列結果將會是冪律分布。
- 地震能量與地震發生次數也遵守冪律分布，當地震能量增加一倍時，該規模的地震發生頻率會減少四分之一。
- Ernest O'Boyle Jr.曾分析2001年至2009年的頂尖學術雜誌中，論文發佈數量和研究者之間的關係。九年中發過一篇論文的佔大多數，但是發表一篇論文以上的研究者數量就大幅減少。

## 文章理念
- 單純提說想要在市場中市占率達到百分之一，或許過於樂觀。
- 13/1000 或是 19/100 才有機會佔整個名額的百分之一。
- 常態分布只有在各自獨立的個體且個體的影響力相同時會發生，像是學校中的學生身高。然而現實生活中多種影響因子的牽連，使得圖表呈現的大多是冪律分布的趨勢。

## 個人反思
- 讓我聯想到前幾天看的影片：[You've (Likely) Been Playing The Game of Life Wrong-Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBluLfX2F_k)
- 影片中也提到了常態分布與冪律分佈，生活中如果你想要成功的話，應該開始針對有興趣的領域不斷地嘗試，因為當次數夠多的時候根據機率，你將會成功。
- 就如同 Alex Hormozi 說的：
    > You should do so much volume that it's unreasonable for you to fail.
    > When in doubt just max the volume
- 就如同 郝旭烈 說的：
    >我從不看評論，我只看一個指標，就是這是第幾集的 podcast。

## 未來應用
- 之前的我時常覺得重複努力幾次後，遇到難關便停下腳步。看完此章節後，我認為可以訂一個誇張的 volume 像是做該實驗 100 次，先寫 100 篇 blog，邊學邊進步。

# Chpater Title
Why High Performers Think Like Scientists (Book) “Is Achieving 1% Market Share in China Really That Easy?” (Section)

## Examples
- Throwing frozen potatoes at a wall results in fragments following a bell curve based on size.
But if you increase the potato’s mass, the distribution shifts and follows a power law.
- Earthquake energy vs. number of occurrences also follows a power law:
Doubling the energy reduces the frequency of such earthquakes to one-quarter.
- Ernest O’Boyle Jr. analyzed top academic journals (2001–2009) and found that although most researchers published only one paper, the number of researchers who published more than one decreases sharply—a classic power-law pattern.

## Core Ideas
- Saying “we want to achieve 1% market share” is often overly optimistic.
- In reality, hitting that target typically requires being at a level like 13 out of 1000 or 19 out of 100 in performance or results.
- Normal distributions appear only when individual units are independent and have equal influence (e.g., student height).In the real world, with many interconnected variables, data almost always follow power-law distributions instead.

## Personal Reflection
- This reminded me of a video I watched recently: [You've (Likely) Been Playing The Game of Life Wrong-Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBluLfX2F_k)
- The video also discussed how success in the real world follows power laws, not normal distributions.
If you want to succeed, you need to keep trying within a domain you care about—in enough repetitions, probability ensures success.
- As Alex Hormozi says:
    > You should do so much volume that it’s unreasonable for you to fail.
    > When in doubt, just max the volume.
- As Hao Hsu-Lieh says:
    > I never look at comments. I look at only one metric: what episode number this podcast is.

## Future Application
- I used to quit after 3–5 attempts when hitting obstacles. After reading this chapter, I think I should set ridiculous volume targets:
    – Run an experiment 100 times
    – Write 100 blog posts
    – Make 100 tiny improvements
- Only through repeated execution can I refine my writing, optimize workflows, and build mastery. This cumulative process resembles the Japanese “craftsman spirit”—a rare and powerful trait in any era.
